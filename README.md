## PCB

You can find the PCB layout [here](https://oshwlab.com/pvuarambon/nebulov2_esp32).

## Configuration

The process is the same as for the Sensor.Community firmware.
On the first start, the sation won't find any known network and it will go in AP mode producing a nebuleair-XXXXXXX network. Connect to it from a PC or a smartphone and open the address http://192.168.4.1.
If needed, the password is nebuleaircfg.

For the WiFi connection: type your credentials
For the LoRaWAN connection : type the APPEUI, DEVEUI and APPKEY as created in the Helium or TTN console.

Choose the sensors, the displays and the API in the different tabs. For coding reason, it was not possible to use radios for the PM sensors. Please don't check both sensors of the same type to avoid problemsâ€¦

Please don't decrease the measuring interval to spare connection time.

If the checkbox "WiFi transmission" is not checked, the station will stay in AP mode for 2 minutes and then the LoRaWAN or NBIoT transmissions will start if selected. During those 2 minutes or after a restart, you can change the configuration.

If the checkbox "WiFi transmission" is checked, the sensor will be always accessible through your router with an IP addess : 192.168.<0 or more>.<100, 101, 102â€¦>.

## Configuration NBIoT

The NBIoT (LTE) network should be already set. To change it, it is possible to check a checkbox and restart to force the display off all the networks. Type then the number of the network in the dedicated field and save it with the button. Don't forget to uncheck the configuration checkbox and restart.

## LoRaWAN payload

The payload consists in a 26 bytes (declared as a 27 according to the LMIC library) array.

The values are initialised for the first uplink at the end of the void setup() which is send according to the LMIC library examples.

```
0x00, config = 0 (see below)
0xff, 0xff, sds PM10 = -1
0xff, 0xff, sds PM2.5 = -1
0xff, 0xff, npm PM10 = -1
0xff, 0xff, npm PM2.5 = -1
0xff, 0xff, npm PM1 = -1
0xff, 0xff, npm_nc -1
0xff, 0xff, npm_nc -1
0xff, 0xff, npm_nc -1
0xff, 0xff, ccs811 -1
0xff, 0x80, bme temp = -128
0xff,       bme rh = -1
0xff, 0xff, bme press = -1
0xff, 0xff, cairsens no2 = -1
```

Those default values will be replaced during the normal use of the station according to the selected sensors.

The first byte is the configuation summary, representeed as an array of 0/1 for false/true:

```
configlorawan[0] = cfg::sds_read;
configlorawan[1] = cfg::npm_read;
configlorawan[2] = cfg::bmx280_read;
configlorawan[3] = cfg::ccs811_read;
configlorawan[4] = cfg::enveano2_read;
configlorawan[5] = cfg::rgpd;
configlorawan[6] = cfg::has_nbiot;
configlorawan[7] = cfg::has_wifi;
```

It produce single byte which will have to be decoded on server side.

For example:

10101110 (binary) = 0xAE (hexbyte) =174 (decimal)
The station as a SDS011, a BME280, a Cairsens NO2, RGPD (european privacy law) is checked, the NBIoT is activated, the WiFi is not activated.

If wifi is activated it is useless to decode the uplinks and transmit some downlinks because everything is already done through POST requests.

## NBIoT payload

The data can be transmitted as a JSON (see below for WiFi) or as bytes (octet-stream in a POST request). The option is in the configuration interface.

The payload passed in the body of the POST request consists in a 27 bytes array with a 0 terminator 0x00 at the last position. This terminator is mandatory to close the setup of the transmitted data.

```
0x00, config = 0 (see below)
0xff, 0xff, sds PM10 = -1
0xff, 0xff, sds PM2.5 = -1
0xff, 0xff, npm PM10 = -1
0xff, 0xff, npm PM2.5 = -1
0xff, 0xff, npm PM1 = -1
0xff, 0xff, npm_nc -1
0xff, 0xff, npm_nc -1
0xff, 0xff, npm_nc -1
0xff, 0xff, ccs811 -1
0xff, 0x80, bme temp = -128
0xff,       bme rh = -1
0xff, 0xff, bme press = -1
0xff, 0xff, cairsens no2 = -1
0x00
```

The first byte is the configuation summary, representeed as an array of 0/1 for false/true:

```
confignbiot[0] = cfg::sds_read;
confignbiot[1] = cfg::npm_read;
confignbiot[2] = cfg::bmx280_read;
confignbiot[3] = cfg::ccs811_read;
confignbiot[4] = cfg::enveano2_read;
confignbiot[5] = cfg::rgpd;
confignbiot[6] = cfg::has_lora;
confignbiot[7] = cfg::has_wifi;
```

If the data is sent as byte, the sensor ID and the signal strength are sent as headers of the POST request.

## WiFi payload

Example for transmited data:

`{"software_version" : "ModuleAirV2-V1-122021", "sensordatavalues" : [ {"value_type" : "NPM_P0", "value" : "1.84"}, {"value_type" : "NPM_P1", "value" : "2.80"}, {"value_type" : "NPM_P2", "value" : "2.06"}, {"value_type" : "NPM_N1", "value" : "27.25"}, {"value_type" : "NPM_N10", "value" : "27.75"}, {"value_type" : "NPM_N25", "value" : "27.50"}, {"value_type" : "BME280_temperature", "value" : "20.84"}, {"value_type" : "BME280_pressure", "value" : "99220.03"}, {"value_type" : "BME280_humidity", "value" : "61.66"}, {"value_type" : "samples", "value" : "138555"}, {"value_type" : "min_micro", "value" : "933"}, {"value_type" : "max_micro", "value" : "351024"}, {"value_type" : "interval", "value" : "145000"}, {"value_type" : "signal", "value" : "-71"} ]}`

https is newly implemented.

## Payload formaters

**Uplink**

```
function Decoder(bytes, port) { 

var buf = new ArrayBuffer(bytes.length);
var view1 = new DataView(buf);
var view2 = new DataView(buf);

bytes.forEach(function (b, i) {
    view1.setUint8(i, b);
});

bytes.forEach(function (b, i) {
    view2.setInt8(i, b);
});


if (view1.getUint8(0) < 0 || view1.getUint8(0) > 255 || view1.getUint8(0) % 1 !== 0) {
      throw new Error(byte+ " does not fit in a byte");
  }
  
return {"configuration":("000000000" + view1.getUint8(0).toString(2)).substr(-8),"PM1_SDS":view2.getInt16(1).toString(),"PM2_SDS":view2.getInt16(3).toString(),"PM0_NPM":view1.getInt16(5).toString(),"PM1_NPM":view1.getInt16(7).toString(),"PM2_NPM":view1.getInt16(9).toString(),"N1_NPM":view1.getInt16(11).toString(),"N10_NPM":view1.getInt16(13).toString(),"N25_NPM":view1.getInt16(15).toString(),"VOC_CCS811":view2.getInt16(17).toString(),"T_BME":view2.getInt8(19).toString(),"H_BME":view2.getInt8(21).toString(),"P_BME":view2.getInt16(22).toString(),"NO2":view2.getInt16(24).toString();  
}
